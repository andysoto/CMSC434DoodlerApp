<h1 How to use the app: />

After running the application you will see an empty canvas at the top of the app and all of the drawing features at the bottom of the application. There is a size seekbar in which the user can select the size of the brush. There is an opacity seekbar in which the brush opacity can be adjusted. Next to those, is a textview that changes color to reflect the selection made on the color picker seekbar located below. Next to the text view is a clear button symbolized by a trash can icon. This completely erases the drawing. Next to that is the undo button which will remove the latest stroke made.
